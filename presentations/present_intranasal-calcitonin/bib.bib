abstract = {This clinical practice guideline is based on a series of systematic reviews of published studies on the treatment of symptomatic osteoporotic spinal compression fractures. Of 11 recommendations, one is strong; one, moderate; three, weak; and six, inconclusive. The strong recommendation is against the use of vertebroplasty to treat the fractures; the moderate recommendation is for the use of calcitonin for 4 weeks following the onset of fracture. The weak recommendations address the use of ibandronate and strontium ranelate to prevent additional symptomatic fractures, the use of L2 nerve root blocks to treat the pain associated with L3 or L4 fractures, and the use of kyphoplasty to treat symptomatic fractures in patients who are neurologically intact.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED Determinants of mortality were studied in a prospective study of 677 women and men with primary or secondary osteoporosis. Prevalent vertebral fractures were associated with increased mortality, but other known predictors of mortality explain a significant proportion of the excess risk. INTRODUCTION In population studies, prevalent vertebral fractures are associated with increased mortality. It is unknown whether this excess mortality is related to low bone mineral density or its determinants or whether there is an additional component associated with fracture itself. METHODS We studied 677 women and men with osteoporosis, 28-88 years old, of whom 352 had morphometrically determined vertebral fracture, to examine the risk and causes of mortality in patients with osteoporosis (defined densitometrically as a spine bone mineral density T-score {\textless} -2.5 and -3.0 for women and men, respectively, and/or one or more prevalent vertebral fractures without a history of significant trauma). The participants had enrolled in a double-blind placebo-controlled study in osteoporosis and were comprised of 483 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, 110 women with secondary osteoporosis, and 84 men with osteoporosis of any cause. Demographics, medical history, and other measures of skeletal and nonskeletal health status were assessed at entry. RESULTS During a median follow-up of 3.2 years, 37 (5.5{\%}) participants died, with 31 of these deaths occurring in those with prevalent vertebral fractures. Compared with participants who did not have a prevalent vertebral fracture, those with one or more fractures had a 4.4-fold higher (95{\%} CI, 1.85, 10.6) mortality rate. After adjustment for predictors for poor health--including number of medications, number of diseases, use of oral corticosteroids, alcohol intake, serum albumin and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), renal function, height, weight, gender, and age--the point estimate of risk remained elevated but was no longer statistically significant (hazard ratio, 2.4; 95{\%} CI, 0.93, 6.23). CONCLUSIONS Prevalent vertebral fractures in osteoporotic patients are associated with increased mortality. Other known predictors of mortality can explain a significant proportion of the excess risk.},

@article{Cauley2000,
abstract = {To examine the risk of mortality following all clinical fractures, we followed 6459 women age 55-81 years participating in the Fracture Intervention Trial for an average of 3.8 years. All fractures and deaths were confirmed by medical record or death certificate. Clinical fractures were fractures that came to medical attention. Fracture status was used as a time-dependent covariate in proportional hazards models. The 907 women who experienced a fracture were older, had lower bone mineral density and were more likely to report a positive fracture history. A total of 122 women died over the course of the study with 23 of these deaths occurring after a clinical fracture. The age-adjusted relative risk (95{\%} confidence intervals) of dying following a clinical fracture was 2.15 (1.36, 3.42). This primarily reflected the higher mortality following a hip fracture, 6.68 (3.08, 14.52); and clinical vertebral fracture, 8.64 (4.45, 16.74). Results were similar after adjusting for treatment assignment, health status and specific common comorbidities. There was no increase in mortality following a forearm or other fracture (non-hip, non-wrist, nonvertebral fracture). In conclusion, clinical vertebral fractures and hip fractures are associated with a substantial increase in mortality among a group of relatively healthy older women.},
