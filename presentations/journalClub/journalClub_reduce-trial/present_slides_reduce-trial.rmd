1. *Background learning points*
    - AECOPD diagnosed using Winnipeg criteria (/"cardinal"/ diagnostic criteria)

    - where 5 days of steroids originates
    - follow up to [SCCOPE trial](https://doi.org/10.1016/s0197-2456(98)00011-7), which proved efficacy of steroids on AECOPD
	- looked at placebo, 2 weeks, 8 weeks of steroids
2. *Discussion points*
    - non-inferiority trial
        - what does "non-inferior" mean?
	    - is it ever "better?"
    - external validity concerns
