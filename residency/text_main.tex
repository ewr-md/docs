	\section{Overview}
	\paragraph{}
		This document hopes to suggest a series of concrete, actionable projects that are aimed at improving resident workflows, quality of life, and professional competencies.
		I have not identified any problems without offering at least one possible solution, as reporting issues is less helpful without a plan to improve the underling pain point.
	\paragraph{}
		This document is broken down by section, with clickable hyperlinks in the Table of Contents.
	\section{Create a Residency Wiki}
		\textbf{Bottom line:} We should move away from using email and Canvas to disseminate and organize our program information and adopt a Wiki-based approach.
		\subsection{The Problem}
		Many large organizations, including governmental bodies, corporate entities, and non-profit organizations codify their standard operating procedures (SOPs).
		This is typically done for the following reasons:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item It minimizes workflow friction when workers leave or transition.
				\item It allows SOPs to be vetted, amended, or removed entirely.
				\item It allows for an easy-to-see 
			\end{itemize}
